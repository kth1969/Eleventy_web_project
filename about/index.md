title: About the Project
---

It is a 9 Days student Web-project in Digital Ideation HSLU Luzern.
The screen shots are from the Webpage Wayback Archiv and the selection was curated by me, Karin Fischer. There are popular webpages from different sections that I could think of. I tried to find early adopters to the internet to show also the changes of the pages in timeline and more than one example in a rubrik to compare them with each other. Mainly the selection contains international and swiss webpages from art museum, newspaper and magazins, artists, tv channels, public transport and Technology companies.
